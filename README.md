- 👋 Hi, I’m @aralper. I have been continuing node testnets for a long time, which I started with the Aleo project. Additionally, I participate in platform testnets in many projects. I have installed approximately 35-40 nodes such as Aleo, Sui, Subspace, Bundler, Aptos, Obol, Stride and Massa. I currently have ongoing nodes in Subspace, Dymension, Fleek, Avail and Ar.io projects.
