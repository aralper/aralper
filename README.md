- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aralper. I have been continuing node testnets for a long time, which I started with the Aleo project. Additionally, I participate in platform testnets in many projects. I have installed approximately 55-60 nodes such as Aleo, Sui, Subspace, Bundler, Aptos, Obol, Stride, Dymension, Avail, Ä°nitia and Fleek. I currently have ongoing nodes in Subspace, Shardeum, Warden, Boundless, Gensyn and Pluralis projects. Moreover Ä± run mainnet validatÃ¶r in Massa, Humanode and Ario project.

I generally rent the systems through Hetzner, Vast and Quickpod. I use Vps and Dedicated systems that are required according to desired systems. As an example, I use; 
CPU: AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 9 7950X3D, RAM: 128 GB DDR5 ECC, NVMe SSD: 4TB NVMe SSD Gen4
