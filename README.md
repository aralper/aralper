- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aralper. I have been continuing node testnets for a long time, which I started with the Aleo project. Additionally, I participate in platform testnets in many projects. I have installed approximately 45-50 nodes such as Aleo, Sui, Subspace, Bundler, Aptos, Obol, Stride, Dymension, Avail and Fleek. I currently have ongoing nodes in Subspace, Shardeum, Warden, Mantra, Overnode, Ä°nitia and Ar.io projects. Moreover Ä± run mainnet validatÃ¶r in Massa.
